# What's New? - Updates from the Previous Example

Now all the Blueprints examples have been updated with new Slack platform features. So what are the *diffs* in this updated example?

### Modals

*Major updates!: This requires to update your code!*

We released [Modals](https://api.slack.com/block-kit/surfaces/modals), which is replacing the existing Dialogs, with more powerful features.

Now, instead of calling an API to open a dialog is replaced with the new view API to open a modal with Block Kit in the code sample.

### OAuth Token

Your OAuth access token should begins with `-xoxb` instead of `-xoxp`. The bot tokens will be the defaul token in future.


### Sigining Secret 

*This requires to update your code!*

Previously, you needed to verify a *verificatin token* to see if a request was coming from Slack, not from some malicious place by simply comparing a string with the legacy token with a token received with a payload. But now you must use more secure *sigining secrets*.

Basically, you need to compare the value of the `X-Slack-Signature`, the HMAC-SHA256 keyed hash of the raw request payload, with a hashed string containing your Slack signin secret code, combined with the version and `X-Slack-Request-Timestamp`. 

Learn more at [Verifying requests from Slack](https://api.slack.com/docs/verifying-requests-from-slack).


### Token rotation

OAuth refresh tokens are also introduced as a security feature, which allows the app owners to proactively rotate tokens when the tokens are compromised.

Your workspace app can use the new `apps.uninstall` method to uninstall itself from a single workspace, revoking all tokens associated with it. To revoke a workspace token without uninstalling the app, use `auth.revoke`.

Although the example of using the short-lived refresh token is *not* included in this Blurprints example since this tutorial is written for internal integration, if you are distributing your app, use a short-lived OAuth Refresh token. Implementing token rotation is required for all apps that are distributed, whether submitted for the App Directory or not.

To lean more, read [Token rotation for workspace apps](https://api.slack.com/docs/rotating-and-refreshing-credentials).


:gift: If you are using the [Node SDK](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/issues/617), the token refresh feature is available for you already!
